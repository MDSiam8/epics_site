            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>	
               The EPICS club at North Penn High School was formed in 2009 with assistance from Dr. Kapil Dandekar, ECE professor, at Drexel University.
               During the summer of 2009, Mr. Boyer traveled to Purdue University to participate in the EPICS-High summer training program and to learn about the benefits of starting an EPICS High program at North Penn High school.
               During the 2009-2010 school, a core group of interested students met weekly after school to draft a charter to begin an EPICS program at North Penn High School.  The students drafted a charter and presented it to the high school senate.
               The first EPICS club endeavor was a partnership with the EPICS program at Drexel University and The Clean Air Council of Philadelphia.  Students learned how to implement and monitor an air quality sensor network, collect data and draw conclusions from the experiments.  The students also learned how to design and create power supply circuit boards to be used in the air quality sensors.
               Since 2009, the EPICS club has had many exciting research and design endeavors.
               The images below are from the 1st EPICS club at North Penn High School (2009-2010).  The NPHS students worked with Drexel University students and the Clean Air Council of Philadelphia to design, construct, monitor and assess air quality.
